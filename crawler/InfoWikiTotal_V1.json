However, when exposed to high hydrostatic pressure, these crystals have a tetragonal structure associated to alpha (α-Ag2MoO4) metastable phase.[2] Recently, the literature [3] has reported the formation of α-Ag2MoO4 metastable phase by the solution-phase precipitation method under environment condition, and using 3-bis(2-pyridyl)pyrazine (dpp) as doping.

In other studies, Ag-Ag2MoO4 composites prepared by microwave-assisted hydrothermal synthesis presented interesting photocatalytic activity for the degradation of Rhodamine B under visible light.[6] In addition, Ag2MoO4 mixed with graphite acts as a good lubricant for Ni-based composites, improving the tribological properties of this system.[7] Different synthesis methods have been employed to obtain pure β-Ag2MoO4 crystals, including solid-state reaction or oxide mixture at high temperature,[8] melt-quenching [9] and Czochralski growth.[10] Particularly, high temperatures, long processing times, and/or sophisticated equipment are necessary in these synthetic routes.

The term may refer to either of two structural isomers, n-butane or isobutane (also called \"methylpropane\"), or to a mixture of these isomers. In the IUPAC nomenclature, however, \"butane\" refers only to the n-butane isomer (which is the isomer with the unbranched structure). Butanes are highly flammable, colorless, easily liquefied gases that quickly vaporize at room temperature. The name butane comes from the roots but- (from butyric acid, named after the Greek word for butter) and -ane. It was discovered by the chemist Edward Frankland in 1849.[6]","id":"C4H10"},{"info":"Butanol (also called butyl alcohol) is a four-carbon alcohol with a formula of C4H9OH, which occurs in five isomeric structures, from a straight-chain primary alcohol to a branched-chain tertiary alcohol;[1] all are a butyl or isobutyl group linked to a hydroxyl group (sometimes represented as BuOH, n-BuOH, and i-BuOH). These are n-butanol, 2 stereoisomers of 2-butanol, tert-butanol, and isobutanol. Butanol is primarily used as a solvent, as an intermediate in chemical synthesis, and as a fuel.

Butyric acid is found in milk, especially goat, sheep and buffalo milk, butter, parmesan cheese, and as a product of anaerobic fermentation (including in the colon and as body odor). It is also suspected to be found in milk chocolate produced by the Hershey process, or added to imitate the flavour of Hershey's chocolate.[9] Butyric acid is present in, and is the main distinctive smell of, human vomit.[10] It has an unpleasant smell and acrid taste, with a sweetish aftertaste similar to ether.
